# EtherChecker
Check the current price of ETH, the gas used for fueling transactions on the Ethereum Blockchain!

EtherChecker is an easy-to-use Java application that lets you choose which cryptocurrency exchange you want to check for the current ETH price. It uses the Cryptowat.ch API to read the prices on each exchange.
It is now also possible to check the amount of Ether associated with any wallet on the Ethereum Blockchain.
This feature uses the Etherscan.io API.
To start the application, simply execute EtherChecker.jar!
