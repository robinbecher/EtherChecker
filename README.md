# EtherChecker
Check the current price of ETH, the gas used for fueling transactions on the Ethereum Blockchain!

EtherChecker is an easy-to-use Java application that lets you choose which Cryptocurrency Exchange you want to check for the current ETH price. It uses the Cryptowat.ch API to read the prices on each exchange.
To start the Application simply execute EtherChecker.jar!

This hobby project's use is mainly for helping me practice my programming skills.
If the software does not work as intended, please contact me.
I am not responsible for any problems that the use of EtherChecker entails.
